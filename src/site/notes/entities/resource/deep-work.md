<h1>Deep Work</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport makes the case that the ability to focus without distraction is becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. Newport defines &quot;deep work&quot; as professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Core Message</h3>
<p>The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it's becoming increasingly valuable. Those who cultivate this skill will thrive.</p>
<h3>Key Arguments/Points</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deep work produces value</strong>: Complex tasks require focused attention</li>
<li><strong>Shallow work is deceptive</strong>: It feels productive but rarely creates value</li>
<li><strong>Attention is finite</strong>: Protect it like the resource it is</li>
<li><strong>Rituals matter</strong>: Create consistent environments and routines for deep work</li>
<li><strong>Boredom training</strong>: Your ability to concentrate is a skill that must be trained</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notable Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you don't produce, you won't thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My Notes</h2>
<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>The distinction between deep and shallow work has transformed how I structure my day. I now protect my morning hours for deep work on challenging problems, saving email and meetings for afternoon &quot;shallow work&quot; time.</p>
<h3>How It Changed My Thinking</h3>
<p>Made me realize that constant connectivity is the enemy of valuable work. The temporary discomfort of being unreachable is worth the output gained from focused sessions.</p>
<h3>Questions It Raised</h3>

<li><a href="/garden/dev_admin/question/how-does-sleep-affect-learning/" class="internal-link">How Does Sleep Affect Learning</a> - How does sleep affect ability to do deep work?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Action Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] Block 4 hours of daily deep work time</li>
<li>[x] Quit social media during workday</li>
<li>[ ] Develop &quot;shutdown complete&quot; ritual</li>
<li>[ ] Train boredom tolerance (no phone during waiting times)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rating &amp; Review</h2>
<p><strong>Overall Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Makes a compelling case backed by research and examples</li>
