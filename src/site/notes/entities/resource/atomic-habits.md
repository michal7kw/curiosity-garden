<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Core Message</h3>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Small changes, consistently applied, lead to remarkable results. Focus on systems (daily habits) rather than goals (outcomes).</p>
<h3>Key Arguments/Points</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The 1% Rule</strong>: Getting 1% better every day means you'll be 37x better after one year</li>
<li><strong>The Habit Loop</strong>: Cue → Craving → Response → Reward</li>
<li><strong>Identity over outcomes</strong>: &quot;I'm a reader&quot; is more powerful than &quot;I want to read more&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Environment matters more than motivation</strong>: Design your spaces for success</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notable Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My Notes</h2>
<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>The &quot;two-minute rule&quot; has been transformative: make any habit easy by starting with just two minutes. Want to read more? Just read one page. This overcomes the initial resistance that derails most habit attempts.</p>
<h3>How It Changed My Thinking</h3>
<p>Shifted focus from motivation to environment design. Instead of relying on willpower, I now set up my environment to make good habits easy and bad habits hard.</p>
<h3>Questions It Raised</h3>

<li>[x] Implement habit stacking for morning routine</li>
<li>[x] Design environment for <a href="/garden/dev_admin/resource/deep-work/" class="internal-link">Deep Work</a> sessions</li>
<li>[ ] Track habits for 66 days (habit formation period)</li>
</ul>
