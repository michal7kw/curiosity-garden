<h1>Learning Is About Connections</h1>
<h2>The Insight</h2>
<p>True learning happens not through isolated memorization, but through connecting new information to your existing knowledge network. The more connections a piece of information has, the more deeply it's understood and the more easily it's remembered.</p>
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>This insight fundamentally shifts how to approach learning. Instead of treating subjects as separate silos, you actively look for connections between ideas. This makes learning more efficient, more enjoyable, and more durable.</p>
<h2>The Context</h2>
<p>This insight crystallized while studying <a href="/garden/dev_admin/course/learning-how-to-learn/" class="internal-link">Learning How to Learn</a> and reflecting on why some things stick effortlessly while others require constant re-learning. It explains why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experts learn faster in their domain (more hooks for new info)</li>
<li>Isolated facts are forgotten quickly</li>
<li>Cross-disciplinary thinking often yields breakthroughs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>Multiple sources reinforced this insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/garden/dev_admin/course/learning-how-to-learn/" class="internal-link">Learning How to Learn</a> - Chunking and neural connections</li>
<li>Personal experience with <a href="/garden/dev_admin/skill/python-programming/" class="internal-link">Python Programming</a> - Understanding concepts vs. memorizing syntax</li>
<li><a href="/garden/dev_admin/concept/the-feynman-technique/" class="internal-link">The Feynman Technique</a> - Forcing connections through explanation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chunking in neuroscience</strong>: The brain stores related information in connected &quot;chunks&quot; that can be recalled as units</li>
<li><strong>Semantic networks</strong>: Memory research shows information is stored in connected networks, not isolated nodes</li>
<li><strong>Expert vs. novice studies</strong>: Experts organize knowledge around deep principles with rich connections; novices use surface features</li>
<li><strong><a href="/garden/dev_admin/concept/spaced-repetition/" class="internal-link">Spaced Repetition</a> effectiveness</strong>: Works better when cards connect to prior knowledge</li>
</ol>
<h2>Potential Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial learning still requires attention</strong>: Can't skip the focused effort to create first connections</li>
<li><strong>Wrong connections hurt</strong>: Misconceptions create incorrect connections that are hard to fix</li>
<li><strong>Too many connections can overwhelm</strong>: Need to prioritize meaningful connections</li>
<li><strong>Some facts are genuinely isolated</strong>: Not everything connects meaningfully</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>When learning something new (cooking, fitness, home repair), actively connect it to what I already know. Look for underlying principles that connect domains.</p>
<h3>Work/Projects</h3>
<p>When studying <a href="/garden/dev_admin/skill/python-programming/" class="internal-link">Python Programming</a>, connect new concepts to previous programming experience, to mathematical principles, to problem-solving patterns from other domains.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>When meeting new people, connect what they share to what I know. This creates genuine interest and better memory of conversations.</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] When using <a href="/garden/dev_admin/resource/anki/" class="internal-link">Anki</a>, always add context and connections to cards</li>
<li>[x] When reading <a href="/garden/dev_admin/resource/deep-work/" class="internal-link">Deep Work</a> or <a href="/garden/dev_admin/resource/atomic-habits/" class="internal-link">Atomic Habits</a>, actively note connections to other books</li>
<li>[ ] Create a personal knowledge graph to visualize connections</li>
<li>[ ] Before learning new topic, explicitly activate prior related knowledge</li>
<li>[ ] Review learning notes weekly to find new cross-topic connections</li>
